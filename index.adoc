* Introduction
** 1 minute
** My goal with this is to share with you some of the basics of using the
   terminal on your computer, so that perhaps we can bring everybody here just a
   little bit closer to the level of command line wizardry that our engineers
   have.

== Why use the command line?

[%step]
* Greater control over your OS and applications
* Often faster than using a graphical interface
* Automate _all of the things_

== Quick note about Windows

* cmd.exe and Powershell not covered here
* ...but you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

== Let's type some commands!

== Some useful shortcuts

* *Ctrl+C*: interrupt the current command
* *Ctrl+D*: exit the terminal
* *Ctrl+L*: clear the screen
* *Ctrl+A*: jump to beginning of line
* *Ctrl+E*: jump to end of line
* *Ctrl-U*: delete before cursor
* *Ctrl-K*: delete after cursor
