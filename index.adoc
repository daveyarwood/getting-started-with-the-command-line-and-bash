* Introduction
** 1 minute
** My goal with this is to share with you some of the basics of using the
   terminal on your computer, so that perhaps we can bring everybody here just a
   little bit closer to the level of command line wizardry that our engineers
   have.

== Why use the command line?

[.notes]
--
* 2 minutes

[%step]
* Greater control over your OS and applications
* Often faster than using a graphical interface
* Automate _all of the things_

== Quick note about Windows

[.notes]
--
* 2 minutes
--

* cmd.exe and Powershell not covered here
* ...but you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

== Let's type some commands!

== Some useful shortcuts

[.notes]
--
* 7 minutes

* *Up / Down*: go backward/forward in history
* *Tab*: auto-complete commands / file names (super useful!)
* *Ctrl+C*: interrupt the current command
* *Ctrl+D*: exit the terminal
* *Ctrl+L*: clear the screen
* *Ctrl+W*: delete last word
* *Ctrl+A*: jump to beginning of line
* *Ctrl+E*: jump to end of line
* *Ctrl+U*: delete before cursor
* *Ctrl+K*: delete after cursor

== Files and directories

[.notes]
--
* 10 minutes
--

* *pwd* - print working directory
* *cd* - change directory
* *ls* - list files in directory
* *find* - search for files

== Let's write a script!

[.notes]
--
* Free form, use whatever time is remaining, be interactive
* Start by showing how to create and run a script
** `chmod +x`, `./my-script`, etc.
* Talk about shebang line
* Put a few commands like `hostname`, `whoami`, `date` on separate lines
* Interpolation, subshells
* Script idea: status checker for the Kevel website
** Start with basic `curl https://kevel.co`
** `-L` to follow redirects
** `-w "%{http_code}"` to just print 200
** `echo -n "Kevel website status: "`
** Run it in a loop in the shell, then put the loop in the script
